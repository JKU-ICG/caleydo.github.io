abstract: "The aim of visualization is to support humans in dealing with large and complex information structures, to make these structures more comprehensible, facilitate exploration, and enable knowledge dis- covery. However, users often have problems reading and interpreting data from visualizations, in particular when they experience them for the first time. A lack of visualization literacy, i.e., knowledge in terms of domain, data, visual encoding, interaction, and also analyti- cal methods can be observed. To support users in learning how to use new digital technologies, the concept of onboarding has been successfully applied in other domains. However, it has not received much attention from the visualization community so far. With our position paper, we aim to work towards filling this gap by proposing a design space of onboarding in the context of visualization."
